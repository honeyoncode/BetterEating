This is a modified version of RecipeTin Eats' [doner kebab](https://www.recipetineats.com/doner-kebab-meat-recipe-beef-or-lamb/). When I made it I 1) forgot to prep the meat ahead of time and 2) didn't realise it was supposed to be cooked low and slow, so I made some amendments and thought it came out okay! 

If you're lazy, follow my version. If you want something better, probably follow theirs.

### Ingredients
- 500g 20% fat minced beef
- 500g 20% fat minced pork
- 1 red onion
- 1 small head of white cabbage
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 3 tsp salt
- 6-8 pita breads

### Steps
Preheat your oven to 200C.

Put all the spices in a large bowl, add both types of meat, and then knead it with your hand until it's one big glob of meaty meatness. Lay out some foil, plop the meat on it and form it into a large cylinder shape. Roll the meat up in the foil, folding each end so that the juices won't escape.

Thread two long skewers through the meat log and then rest the ends across a roasting tin so that the meat hangs in the middle.

Bake in the oven for 45 minutes, then check with a meat thermometer that it is cooked all the way through. If it needs a little longer, throw it back in for 15 minutes.

While the meat is cooking, thinly slice the cabbage and red onion then mix together with a light sprinkling of salt.

Take the meat out, and very carefully remove the foil so as not to burn yourself. With a sharp knife, hold the meat upright and slice thin strips off.

Toast your pita breads in the toaster, slice them open and add some of the cabbage & onion mix with the meat and top with a sauce of your choice. Done!
