### Ingredients
- 1L chicken or veggie broth
- 1.5L water
- 3 celery stalks, cut in half
- 3 carrots, peeled and cut in half
- 6 garlic cloves, whole
- 1 whole onion, yellow or white
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp chicken bouillon
- Pastina, orzo, or other pasta of choice
- Parmesan cheese for serving

### Steps
In a large pot combine the water and chicken broth. Add all the veggies and then bring to a boil. Once boiling, partially cover and cook for 45 minutes.

Cook pasta, add to broth then grate parmesan cheese on top and serve.
