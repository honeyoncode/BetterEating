### Ingredients
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- 500g stewing steak, in chunks
- 2 red onions, sliced
- 350g carrots, chopped
- 500ml low salt beef stock
- 150ml red wine
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 tsp dried mixed herbs
- 175g button mushrooms, halved if large
- 40g dried buckwheat groats (kasha) per portion


### Steps
Preheat oven to 170°C/fan 15O°C /gas mark 3. Combine flour and black pepper in a bowl or polythene food bag. Add beef and coat in flour mixture. Shake off excess flour, if necessary.

Heat 2 tsp oil in a flameproof, ovenproof casserole dish. Add beef; cook over a medium-low heat for about 5 minutes or until lightly browned and sealed all over, turning regularly. Remove beef to a plate; set aside.

Add onions, garlic, carrots and remaining oil to casserole dish; cook gently for about 5 minutes until onions start to soften, stirring occasionally. Return beef to casserole; stir in stock, wine, tomato puree and dried herbs. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.

Cover casserole dish tightly; cook in oven for 1 hour. Stir in mushrooms; return to oven and cook for a further 30-45 minutes or until beef is very tender. While cooking boil the buckwheat groats according to package instructions. Serve!
