### Ingredients
- 115g dried wholemeal pasta
- 55g leek, finely chopped
- 55g fresh broccoli, chopped
- 55g frozen peas
- 175g chicken breast, chopped
- 25g reduced-fat spread
- 25g plain flour
- 200ml semi-skimmed milk
- 25g reduced-fat cheddar cheese, grated

### Steps
Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Throw in the pasta, stir well and return to the boil. Cook for five minutes, then add the vegetables and chicken. Simmer gently for a further 10 minutes or until both the pasta and chicken are tender. Drain well.

Meanwhile, put the reduced-fat spread, flour and milk in a small saucepan. Set over a medium heat and whisk constantly until the mixture comes to the boil. Reduce the heat, continue whisking until the sauce is thickened and smooth. Stir in all but a teaspoon of the cheese. Season with black pepper.

Divide the pasta and chicken mixture between two small, deep ovenproof dishes. Spoon over the sauce and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. If freezing the dish, do so now, and then defrost overnight in the fridge before using.

If eating immediately, grill until golden. Alternatively, keep chilled for up to one day and then bake at 170°C/150°C fan/ gas mark 3 for 30–40 minutes until piping hot.
