### Ingredients
- 64g coconut flour
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp salt
- 3 eggs
- 118ml coconut oil (melted)
- 60ml coconut milk
- 80ml agave syrup (alternatives: maple syrup, honey)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 egg whites
- 10-12 strawberries
- 250ml double cream
- Strawberry jam



### Steps
Preheat the oven to 176’C. Line the bottom of a cake pan with unbleached parchment paper, cut into a circle to neatly fit the bottom.

In a large bowl, sift together the coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Set it to one side.

In another bowl, whisk together the 3 eggs, coconut oil, coconut milk, agave syrup (or maple syrup / honey), and vanilla until it is foamy.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and milk well.

In another large bowl beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until thick, soft peaks form. Fold very gently into the cake batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.

Bake for 25-28 minutes, until a knife inserted into the centre comes out clean and the cake is golden.

Let the cake cool on a wire rack for approximately 20-30 minutes, then spread a layer of jam over the top of the cake. 

Whip the double cream until it is thick, then spread it on top of the jam. Finally, cut the strawberries in half and place them around the edge of the cake.

Note: I found that 28 minutes wasn’t long enough, it may be the setting I used on the oven but I left it for a further 20 minutes and it was perfect. Use your own judgement, but resist the urge to check too often or you’ll let all the heat out of the oven!
