### Ingredients
- 200g wholewheat spaghetti
- 150g frozen peas
- 75g spinach
- 25g walnuts
- 25g grated parmesan
- 75g fat-free fromage frais
- 2tsp lemon juice
- 2 chicken breasts
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Steps
Set the oven to 200C fan and line a baking tray with foil or baking paper.

Rub around a tablespoon of olive oil over the chicken breasts, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for around 20 minutes until the internal temperature reads 165F / 75C.

While the chicken is cooking, put the spaghetti in boiling water for around 10 minutes, until it's al-dente.

Meanwhile, boil the peas for a couple of minutes then drain well. Take half the peas and put them in a food processor along with the spinach, nuts, parmesan, fromage frais and lemon juice. Blitz until smooth.

Take the chicken out of the oven, and give it a minute to cool slightly. Slice the chicken.

Drain the spaghetti, add the chicken, and toss with the sauce and remaining peas.
