## Welcome to Better Eating.

This is a recipe collection site with one goal in mind:
- Improve the quality of food we eat.

We recognise that the average person doesn't necessarily have the time or energy to spend hours in the kitchen. Recipes listed here should:
- Use ingredients commonly found in most supermarkets.*
- Require no more than one hour's effort.
- Aim to be healthy.**

\* I'm based in the UK, so "commonly found in most supermarkets" will be skewed to the UK.

\** What constitutes a healthy recipe is probably up for debate. In this case it should try to be low calorie, filling, with a variety of veggies and overall be nutritious. It doesn't have to be perfect, because sometimes "best" is out of reach, so "better" is good enough.
